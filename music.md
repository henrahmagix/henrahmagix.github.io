## Improvisations

I sometimes post piano improvisations on [my SoundCloud]({{site.data.links.music.ext_url}}) <i class="{{site.data.links.music.icon}}" aria-hidden="true"></i> and [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGGooHDGChBvbXYoEkcDeew) <i class="fas fa-video" aria-hidden="true"></i>.

Whilst the UK is in lockdown from Covid-19 in the first half of 2020, I've been imagining going on an adventure. I think the imagery in my head is reflected in the improvisations I've recorded during this time. Below is the playlist, which will grow as I record more:

## Performances

I've also recorded myself playing Rachmaninov's Prelude in G-sharp minor, Op. 32, No. 12.
